## Introduction

Explain your motivation for pursuing this project. You should include background information on the task.

[Motivation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACmydtFDTGs&ab_channel=HBO)

## Dataset

You do not have to upload the dataset to your GitHub repository, but you should include clear instructions on how to access the data, download it, and set it up in your repository.

## Model

Explain the model architecture that your project uses. Be sure to include an architecture diagram here!

## Using this Repository

Please provide detailed instructions on how your codebase works. Ideally, someone should be able to recreate your model by following this guide.

### Requirements

Give instructions on setting up the environment.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate hotdog
```

### Training the Model

Explain how to train the model using the scripts in your repository.

```
python train.py
```

### Using the Model

Explain how to use the model. Show a few examples in your `demo.ipynb`.

## References

You __must__ include references to any papers or GitHub repositories which you used when working on your project.

If you borrowed code from another GitHub repository, you __must__ clearly write in your comments what is outsourced (and from where) and what is your own.

Failure to properly credit external sources constitutes plagarism.
